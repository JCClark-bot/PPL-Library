# PPL-Library
The Process Protocol Layer (PPL) is a universal schema for describing any process — from brewing coffee to validating a vaccine.   This repository serves as the **core library**, documenting the schema, example processes, and applications across industries.

## 🌐 What is PPL?

Like DNA’s four bases, PPL reduces any process into a simple but universal structure.  
Every process, no matter how complex, can be expressed with five core elements:

1. **Inputs** – The data, documents, or materials required to begin.  
   *Examples: lab test results, a customer application form, a meeting agenda.*

2. **Preconditions** – The conditions that must be true before starting.  
   *Examples: “approval granted,” “data verified,” “quorum present.”*

3. **Activity** – The description of the action to be performed.  
   *Examples: “mix ingredients,” “conduct meeting,” “validate data.”*

4. **Outputs** – The expected result(s) of the activity.  
   *Examples: “final report generated,” “batch compounded,” “decision recorded.”*

5. **Approvals** – Verification or sign-off steps, human or automated.  
   *Examples: supervisor approval, AI check, regulatory sign-off.*

## 🧩 Additional Layers

PPL supports optional “modifiers” that clarify or extend the five pillars:

- **Decision Artifacts** – Documents, diagrams, or data sets used to guide decisions.  
- **Transitions** – State changes that connect one PPL to another.  
- **Verification** – Defines if a human check or automated validation is required.  
- **Deployment Profile** – Links the PPL definition to actual tools, systems, or environments.
